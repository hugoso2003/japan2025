    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals with Deep Teal Accent -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured as a single-page, multi-section dashboard. A sticky top navigation allows users to jump to key sections: 'Experiences', 'Accommodations', 'Cuisine', and a new 'Travel' section. The 'Experiences' section is the core, using a tab-like button system to filter activities by prefecture. Each activity is presented in a detailed card with a modal popup for even more granular information. The 'Accommodations' section features a new, highly-curated list of top-rated, unique stays. The 'Cuisine' section has prefecture-based filters and detailed cards with local restaurant suggestions. The new 'Travel' section provides a comprehensive overview of regional transportation. This structure was chosen to transform the dense research into a layered, user-driven tool, prioritizing discoverability, detailed planning, and practical logistics. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        1. Report Info: Detailed activity information. Goal: Organize & Inform with depth. Viz/Method: Interactive cards with a "Details" button triggering a modal window (HTML/Tailwind/JS). Interaction: Users click a prefecture filter to see relevant activity cards, then a button to open a detailed modal. Justification: This two-step process manages complexity, providing an overview and an in-depth view on demand.
        2. Report Info: Accommodation listings. Goal: Compare & Filter. Viz/Method: Dropdown filters for prefecture/type, dynamic content cards, and a summary bar chart. Interaction: Filters update the list and the chart. Justification: Provides a multi-faceted tool for users to find and compare high-quality stays that meet their criteria.
        3. Report Info: Cuisine by prefecture. Goal: Organize. Viz/Method: Tab-based card display with detailed content. Interaction: Clicking a prefecture button shows relevant food items with full details and restaurant recommendations. Justification: This expands the previous simple list into a rich, informative section for culinary planning.
        4. Report Info: Regional transportation. Goal: Inform & Plan. Viz/Method: Simple HTML sections with lists and text. Interaction: N/A. Justification: This complex information is best presented clearly and concisely without visualization to ensure easy comprehension.

                        <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">For unlimited travel on most JR train lines and ferries, a regional pass is often the most economical choice for foreign visitors. These passes can save you a significant amount of money if you plan to travel between prefectures.</p>
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-600 space-y-2">
                            <li><strong>JR West All Area Pass:</strong> Offers seven consecutive days of unlimited travel on JR trains (including shinkansen), limited express trains, and local lines in the Kansai, Chugoku, and Hokuriku regions. It also covers the JR ferry to Miyajima.</li>
                            <li><strong>Kansai-Hiroshima Area Pass:</strong> A five-day pass that allows unlimited travel between Kansai and Hiroshima, including the Sanyo Shinkansen. It's a great option if you are flying into Osaka and heading west.</li>
                            <li><strong>Setouchi Area Pass:</strong> A seven-day pass that covers the wider Setouchi region, including train and ferry travel to the art islands of Kagawa and Ehime.</li>
                            <li><strong>Booking Tip:</strong> You can make free seat reservations with these passes, which is highly recommended for popular routes.</li>

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-xl text-blue-700 mb-4">IC Cards: ICOCA</h3>
                        <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">The ICOCA card is a rechargeable IC card used on the JR West rail network. It is a convenient way to pay for public transport without buying individual tickets. The card works on most JR lines, subways, and local buses across the region and is also compatible with other major IC cards (Suica, PASMO) nationwide.</p>
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-600 space-y-2">
                            <li><strong>Where to Buy:</strong> Purchase at JR stations or Kansai International Airport. The card costs ¥2,000, which includes a ¥500 deposit.</li>
                            <li><strong>Where it Works:</strong> Usable on JR lines, local buses, and trams in Okayama, Hiroshima, and parts of the San'in region. It can also be used for small purchases at convenience stores.</li>
                            <li><strong>Important Note:</strong> ICOCA cannot be used on Shinkansen trains, and there are sometimes distance limits for a single journey on local lines.</li>

                            <li><strong>Hiroshima:</strong> The city's streetcars (trams) are an efficient way to get around. Tram line 2 connects the city center to Miyajimaguchi, the ferry terminal for Miyajima Island.</li>
                            <li><strong>Okayama:</strong> The city is a major railway intersection. The Okayama Electric Tramway (Okaden) operates two main lines from Okayama Station, providing easy access to key areas.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hagi (Yamaguchi):</strong> The flat terrain is perfect for cycling. The Hagi City Circular Hop-on Bus offers a convenient and affordable way to visit major tourist sites.</li>
                            <li><strong>Matsue (Shimane):</strong> The Lake Line bus runs a circular route, stopping at all major attractions around the city. An all-day ticket is a great value.</li>
                            <li><strong>Tottori:</strong> The Loop Kirinjishi Bus is a great option for reaching the famous Tottori Sand Dunes on weekends and holidays.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ferries:</strong> Essential for reaching islands like Miyajima and the art islands in the Seto Inland Sea. JR and Matsudai ferries serve Miyajima. An extensive ferry network connects Okayama and Kagawa to the art islands of Naoshima, Teshima, and Inujima.</li>
